# 2. Commenting in Python

#### SINGLE LINE COMMENTS ####
# To write stuff down, comments can be used.
# I will be using comments throughout this repo to add notes to my python scripts

# Scripts: the python file you run is usually termed as a "script". Just a fancy word.

#### Multiple line comments ####
'''
It's hard to add a hash everytime so we add 3 single quotes to write one BIG paragraph.
It get's easier this way. I can write stuff down now without the need to write a # (hash) woih every single line.

In addition to that, comments don't run like code. They are just additional text.
Running this file would output nothing, since it's made up of only comments.

# Why comments are used?
'''
1. Comments can be used to explain Python code.
2. Comments can be used to make the code more readable.
3. Comments can be used to prevent execution when testing code.
