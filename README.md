## Fun Fact

This READme was created by our very own AI friend ChatGPT. I use it to understand code sometimes. It helps me breakdown parts of code so that I understand it. 
Sometimes I do get stuck so I ask it to assist my logic building. Ask it if I am right or wrong. I do basic prompt engineering (build prompts for beter and to the point answers), where I ask it to not reveal the answer. If i still fail, I try not to copy the code but build from scratch after I understand the logic.
